# Changelog

All notable changes to reimagine-it.

---

## Unreleased

- **Skill is a wrapper, not a second engine.** `/reimagine-it` must run `npx reimagine-it`. Hand-authoring HTML when the CLI can run is a fail.
- **Lookbook Auto false positive.** Flu-shot / civic list pages no longer earn lookbook from item count or a bare `collection` / `drop` match. Fashion lane requires streetwear/lookbook language, not `\bdrop\b`.
- **Per-token design kits.** Each direction ships only the CSS primitives it uses (glyphs, charts, prism, mesh, wash, bands). Shared chrome no longer makes 17 pages the same stylesheet. The 3js gutter is an orbit-rail + prism, not dashboard donuts. Benchmark class-set difference is **94.6%** (the old 22.7% figure was file-size distance).
- **Install is two doors.** README leads with CLI + `npx skills add`; host plugins are collapsed. Site, npm description, and llms.txt disambiguate Keith Mangold’s Reimagine It SaaS.
- **skills.sh** install badge is `npx skills add` telemetry, not GitHub stars.
- **CodeQL init/analyze stay on the same SHA** (v4.37.9) so Dependabot cannot split them. Scorecard SARIF upload matches.

## v2.9.0 (current)

### The auditability release — the repo's guarantees are now shown, not just enforced

- **Docs-site parity.** The live site now carries everything the README proves: the security badge row in the hero, an **MCP/agents section** (8 tools, the MCP stanza, the design decision report), a **measured-quality section** (100/100 × 17 tokens, the regenerate-or-CI-fails guarantee, fuzzed honesty, supply-chain posture, offline/deterministic), and footer links to MCP, audit posture, and SECURITY.md. Hero stats corrected (17 tokens, 9 committed journeys).
- **Weekly Scorecard trend report** (`scorecard-report.yml`): every Thursday the aggregate is compared against `.github/scorecard-baseline.json`; a drop opens a regression issue automatically, improvements are reported in the run summary. Baseline starts at 6.7.
- **Scorecard sweep completed.** Token-Permissions, Pinned-Dependencies, Binary-Artifacts, Dangerous-Workflow, Dependency-Update-Tool, License, Packaging, Vulnerabilities all at 10/10. Complete PyPI hash-set pins (Pillow 106, PyYAML 53) replace partial pins after the third-platform-wheel failure; a structural workflow lint (`scripts/check-workflows.py`) now runs **in the required gate** — actionless steps, duplicate keys, loose action tags, and incomplete hash pins cannot merge (negative-tested against the exact outage it prevents).
- **SAST on every push**: CodeQL + Semgrep upload SARIF to code scanning; the audit linter itself is fuzzed weekly (800 adversarial generations, zero crashes).
- **Signed releases**: release assets are cosign keyless-signed (Fulcio/Rekor) alongside npm SLSA provenance.
- **Branch protection at maximum**: `enforce_admins` on — every change, including the owner's, lands through a reviewed PR with the green gate.
- **CII Best Practices answers** drafted from real enforcement (`docs/CII-BADGE-ANSWERS.md`) — every claim maps to a CI check or repo setting.
- **Share assets regenerated** from the current engine (og.png + demo.gif now include both community proofs).

### Upgrading

No breaking changes. `npm i reimagine-it@2.9.0` (or `npx`) — outputs are byte-compatible with 2.8.0 given the same seed.

## v2.8.0

### Two new design directions — the roster is 17

- **`lookbook`** — a photoshoot/editorial spread: oversized display masthead, numbered looks from source anchors, hover-develop plates, anchor marquee, tabular fact chips. Auto earns it via photoshoot/runway/collection vocabulary (deliberately narrow — "flu shots" is a real false positive the reproduction guard caught).
- **`particles`** — a living constellation: seeded canvas field where anchors ride as text particles and facts glow as nodes, with pointer-reactive drift, link webbing, and a full reduced-motion freeze.
- Both wired everywhere: Auto candidates + family map (folio/field), lane bias (fashion → lookbook), rationale strings, craft-floor art-direction check, benchmark, gallery cards + stage buttons, README table, llms.txt, extension README, skills.
- Benchmark rerun: **17/17 tokens at 100/100 usability and full fidelity**; roster mean pairwise diversity **improved 19.9% → 22.7%**.

### Motion system upgrade — AAA micro-interaction pack, on every token

- **Kinetic type**: h1 words rise out of clipped masks with a staggered cascade (DOM-API only — never `innerHTML` — so source text can never re-parse as markup).
- **Magnetic buttons**: actions lean toward the cursor inside a proximity field and spring back (`.magnet`), now applied across CTAs.
- **Glow-follow cards**: a radial accent light tracks the pointer across panels (`.glow-card`).
- **Sheen sweep** on hover for actions (`.fx-sheen`) and a shared **easing token system** (`--ease-out`, `--ease-spring`, `--ease-inout`) replacing ad-hoc curves.
- All new motion is GPU-friendly (transform/opacity), pointer-aware, and inside the existing reduced-motion kill switch.

### 3js — from spinning cube to scene

- Inertia orbit (drag flings, damped velocity settles), depth fog on far faces, breathing ground shadow, twinkling seeded starfield, and **orbiting fact billboards** — source anchors ride three rails around the object with fog-aware opacity.
- Fluid `clamp()` display type (clears the TYPO-02 range warning).

### SVG — the diagram now draws itself

- Staggered node pulse and flowing connector dashes; existing ring/core breathing preserved.

### Verification

- All 10 proof artifacts regenerated through the real pipeline and byte-identical under `check-repro`.
- Browser bundles rebuilt; full suite (gold audit, unit, fuzz, e2e, guards) green.

## v2.7.0

### New commands — the honesty layer becomes a product surface

- **`npx reimagine-it extract`** emits the content signals as JSON: title, profile, density, derived palette, anchors, proper nouns, headings, dates, numbers, emails, links, source hex colors, and counts. `--full` adds prose; stdin → stdout works. Every extracted fact exists in the source — now property-tested.
- **`npx reimagine-it mcp`** runs the MCP server (`mcp/server.js`, 8 tools) via stdio. No separate package needed; verified with a live protocol handshake.

### Skills — the SkillsBench-aligned split is complete

- Three new focused sub-skills: **generate**, **variations**, and **extract**, joining audit/lock/infographic. Each has `trigger_phrases`, `capabilities`, and `keywords` frontmatter for catalog discoverability.

### Trust — proof assets are now CI-enforced

- **Reproduction guard** (`scripts/check-repro.js`): re-runs Auto for every example from `examples.json` and requires committed `auto.html`/`auto.json` to regenerate byte-identically. Needs no Python.
- **Stills guard** (`scripts/check-stills.js`): verifies every proof still exists at canonical dimensions (1400×1100 / 480×960) and matches its docs/ copy; `--pixel` mode re-renders with frozen motion for same-environment pixel regression.
- **Tarball guard** (`scripts/check-tarball.js`): `npm pack` must match the intentional `files:` list exactly.
- **Extractor fuzz tests**: 10 property tests over `src/extract.js` — no invented facts, purity, crash-freedom on hostile/oversized inputs.
- **Weekly fidelity stress**: scheduled CI runs the harness at 250 seeds per token × source cell and fails on any violation.
- **npm provenance**: releases publish with `--provenance` (signed build origin).

### Security & playground

- The playground and token-gallery iframes are **sandboxed** (`allow-scripts` only) — pasted HTML can no longer reach the parent page's DOM or storage.
- Playground gains **fetch-from-URL** (same-origin examples work out of the box) and **Result/Source view tabs**.
- `action.yml` hardened against shell injection via env-var interpolation (community PR #13, merged).
- The 39-second playground walkthrough is now linked from the docs site itself.

### Community & ecosystem

- **Submission pipeline**: `examples/community/TEMPLATE/` plus `scripts/validate-submission.js` (placeholder detection, fidelity floor, artifact reproduction, author credit); `community-gold`, `domain-pack`, and `show-your-gold` labels; CONTRIBUTING documents the lane.
- **Content Signals bot**: new workflow comments the extracted palette/anchors/facts on PRs that touch HTML.
- **Dataset builder** (`scripts/build-dataset.js`): emits HuggingFace-ready JSONL `{source_html, signals, token, seed, fidelity, output_html}` tuples from the committed, engine-verified examples (`--gold` includes the hand-authored tree). 21 tuples / 436 KB today.
- **ROADMAP.md rewritten** for the post-v2.6.0 state: the contradictory pre-2.6.0 sections collapse into a live phased plan.

### Fixed

- The reproduction guard no longer requires Pillow/Python in CI (config moved to `examples/end-users/examples.json`, shared with `build.py`).
- Stale doc reference in `mcp/server.js` pointed at an npm package that was never published.

## v2.6.0

### Examples — two new journeys close the good-first-issue set

- **Hearth & Grain** (`examples/end-users/hearth-grain/`) — a neighborhood bakery whose 16-item bake gallery Auto sends to the **photography** folio at seed 1 (score 226, fidelity 100%). Proves the collection lane without touching the seven launch journeys or their uniqueness test.
- **Millbrook City Budget** (`examples/end-users/millbrook-budget/`) — a civic budget whose compare/timeline/survey language Auto sends to the **infographic** at seed 1 (score 278, fidelity 100%), with the source's own timeline as the first fold (`data-structure="sequence"`).
- Both bundles ship the full kit: `source.html`, `auto.html`, `auto.json`, two alternates, desktop/phone stills, and `before-after.webp`; gallery, manifest, case tables, og card, and demo reel regenerated for nine journeys.
- **Riverside Community Clinic** (`examples/community/riverside-clinic/`) — a ninth-source proof on a job none of the journeys cover, with its committed Auto desktop still (`auto-desktop.png`, 1400×1100) and a written collision check.

### Engine — fidelity floor now holds on fact-rich sources

- The **landing** token renders every measurable fact: a "Every source measure" ledger follows the four KPI cards whenever the source carries more. A hidden 4-fact cap used to silently drop the rest (source fidelity fell to 67% on fact-heavy pages).
- **dashboard**, **artistic**, **svg**, and **3js** tokens likewise render every fact instead of truncating at 4–10. All 135 token × source cells across the nine committed sources now hold the ≥80% floor — and the worst cell is 80%.
- Maracuyá, Velocita, and Horizon previously reported 85–95% fidelity in their committed `auto.json` reports; after the fix every committed example reports 100%. Still, tables, and og/reel assets regenerated from the fixed engine.

### Build — gallery and social scales with the example count

- `examples/end-users/build.py` no longer hardcodes a 2-row gallery height that silently dropped every card past row two; the grid adapts to the card count (ten columns for the current 54 cards, near a 16:9 sheet) and hard-fails if any card does not fit.
- `scripts/build-og.py` adapts its tile width to the case count instead of overflowing the 1200px card; headline counts derive from the list.
- Case lists in `render-example-shots.py`, `sync-pages-assets.py`, and `sync-case-docs.py` extended to nine journeys; docs tables regenerate byte-identically.

### Docs — nine journeys everywhere

- README, GitHub Pages, SHOW-HN, SHOWCASE, CITATION, CONTRIBUTING, ROADMAP, MARKET-GAPS, and the example issue template now say nine journeys and name the two new lanes. A 39-second silent playground walkthrough (`docs/playground-walkthrough.mp4`, 1.1 MB) links beside the live playground; its regenerator lives at `scripts/record-playground.cjs`.
- Version sweep: `2.4.4` appears only as CHANGELOG history; every plugin manifest, skill frontmatter, and badge reads 2.5.0.

## v2.5.0

### Auto — unique composition per source

Auto no longer treats “has numbers” as a reason to ship the same infographic bar-chart poster. Each source is scored into a subject lane (game, festival, skate, food, fashion, architecture, ops, data, reading). Tokens in the same silhouette family cannot occupy the same shortlist, so a juice bar, a skate deck, and a streetwear drop cannot all land on one poster.

When the infographic token *is* the right answer, its first fold follows the source structure (sequence, compare, values, relation, list) instead of a default bar chart.

### Examples — regenerated through the current engine

- All seven end-user journeys (`examples/end-users/`) rebuilt with the v2.5.0 CLI: `auto.html`, alternates, `auto.json`, `before-after.webp`, and `gallery.webp`.
- Pages stills (`docs/examples/end-users/*/auto-desktop.png`, phone shots, Meridian 3js/svg WebP) and the 15-token board (`docs/tokens/`) regenerated from the same engine.
- README, case tables, and GitHub Pages lead with those Auto desktops and the score/fidelity from each `auto.json` — seven tokens, seven silhouettes.
- Social card (`docs/og.png`) and Auto-result reel (`docs/demo.gif`) generated from the same stills. Cite via `CITATION.cff`.
- Removed leftover scale-contract files, the implemented `docs/UPGRADE-PLAN.md`, and the tracked `gold/x-ads/` campaign tree (already gitignored; it was not product proof).

### Feature — four commands, one engine

The CLI is no longer a single generate path with a skill-only lock/audit story. Generate, Auto, variations, lock, and audit share `src/` and are covered by end-to-end tests.

- **`variations`** — `npx reimagine-it variations -i page.html -n 4 -o review/` writes ranked directions plus a contrast sheet. Same source evidence, different compositions, reproducible with `--seed`.
- **`lock` / `--ref`** — `npx reimagine-it lock -i brand.html -o house.lock.json` captures palette, type stack, and voice. `--ref` applies that surface to new content. `--ref` also accepts raw HTML (reverse-lock). Structure stays content-derived; only the surface is pinned.
- **`audit`** — `npx reimagine-it audit page.html` runs Design Health in Node. **19 rules** (registry-derived, not restated in prose). Python `scripts/audit.py` remains the GitHub Action mirror; `test/unit/audit-parity.test.js` fails if they disagree on any file in the repo.
- **`--audit` on generate** — a page that fails its own craft floor exits **3**, not 0 with a warning.
- **MCP** — eight tools: `reimagine`, `design_auto`, `design_variations`, `design_lock`, `extract_content`, `list_tokens`, `audit_html`, `list_rules`. Tool handlers live in `mcp/tools.js` with no SDK import, so they unit-test without `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`.
- **npm pack** now ships `mcp/` (including `tools.js`). Publishing `mcp/server.js` alone would crash `npx reimagine-it-mcp`.
- End-to-end CLI tests cover generate, stdin/stdout, audit exit codes, lock/ref, reverse-lock, and variations.

## v2.4.4

### Docs — one valid product claim

- Public copy matches the engine: **HTML in, standalone HTML out**, derived from headings, facts, names, dates, numbers, links, emails, and colors already in the source.
- Removed the leftover claim that the tool redesigns PDF / PPTX / DOCX / “any file.” Those packs remain optional **host-agent conversion playbooks**, not CLI tokens.
- Version badges, plugin manifests, and skill frontmatter aligned to **2.4.4**. Changelog no longer marks old releases as `(current)`.

### Docs — one public example set

- Public case studies are the seven HTML journeys in `examples/end-users/`.
- Removed superseded Pulsewave / Two Lights / Saffron gold folders and the unused `docs/gold/` Texas/Jules stills.
- `docs/SHOWCASE.md` no longer sells a 13-page Texas gallery as the product proof.
- Landing page no longer advertises gold/five CLI/protocol fixtures as engine output.
- Gold audit sweep skips gitignored local shot files so `npm test` matches CI.
- **npm:** `reimagine-it@2.4.4` is published. Tagged GitHub releases auto-publish through `NPM_TOKEN`.

## v2.4.3

### Fix — token dispatch ran before shared CSS systems were built

- **Root cause: every generated page embedded `undefined` where its shared CSS should be.** The token `switch` (which calls `webpage()`, `landing()`, `dashboard()`, …) sat *above* the `var bandCss` / `var artCss` assignments inside `generate()`. Function declarations hoist, but the CSS strings they embed are assigned in order — so when the switch ran, both were still `undefined`. Every page shipped without its mesh aurora fields, giant data-wash numbers, dot grids, constellations, iso-stacks, glyph tiles, donut charts, mini bars, stats bands, bento grids, and band marquees/footers. Pages still *passed* the craft audit because the checks look at body markup, not the missing CSS.

- **Fix: the dispatch switch now runs after every shared CSS system is assigned.** Output for every token grows by the full band/art CSS (e.g. the venator webpage render 15 KB → 24 KB) and no longer contains a literal `undefined`.

- **Data-wash numbers no longer glue together.** The giant faded source numbers behind heroes used `white-space:nowrap` with no width cap, so `336,000` + `40,000` rendered as one clipped blob (`336,00040,00`). The wash is now `space-evenly` with `gap`, a `32vw` per-span cap, and `text-overflow:ellipsis` at narrow widths — numbers stay separate and legible on desktop and phone.

- **The webpage token's isometric stamp now floats.** `artCss` (prism float, drop shadow, glyph tiles) was never included in the webpage token's stylesheet; the hero stamp now carries it like every other token.

- **All seven end-user examples regenerated through the fixed engine** — `auto.html`, alternates, `before-after.webp`, `gallery.webp`, and the showcase desktop/phone shots are rebuilt, and `docs/engine.js` + `extension/engine.js` are rebuilt so the live playground shares the fix. 57/57 tests pass; browser-bundle freshness green.

## v2.4.2

### Feature — source fidelity floor raised to 80% across every token

- **Every source anchor now survives the redesign** — the engine previously let headings override real source anchors, dropping phrases like “Venator Become” or “Arcade Tee” from the output. Anchors are now headings + source anchors, deduplicated, so all 15 tokens keep every clickable phrase.

- **Links and emails surface on every token** — a shared Source-index footer renders all `content.links` and emails on every page, not just the webpage/landing tokens.

- **Simulation, cinematic, 3js, and dashboard render everything** — facts and anchors are no longer truncated to the first few; each token now shows the full source signal.

- **Result: all 105 token×source fidelity cells ≥80%** (worst token 80%), all seven shipped examples report 100% fidelity in their auto.json reports. A regression test locks the floor (57/57 tests).

- **Extension exposes all 15 tokens** — the popup now lists editorial, motion, gradient, glass, and showcase alongside the original ten; its bundled engine already supported them.

- **Docs can no longer drift** — a `docs-drift` CI job regenerates the case tables and fails the build if they diverge from manifest/auto.json ground truth; benchmark diversity now 19.9% (was 15.6%, a side effect of higher fidelity).

## v2.4.1

### Feature — static before/after composites, faster Pages load

- **GIFs replaced with static before/after WebP images** — every end-user example now ships a single `before-after.webp` (source on the left, strongest redesign on the right, joined by a gold arrow) instead of a multi-frame animated GIF. The gallery became a static WebP grid. Typical savings: 460–610 KB GIF → 36–54 KB WebP, and the 3.7 MB gallery animation → 133 KB. The token gallery and the meridian suite (3js orbit, svg diagram) use static renders instead of animation loops.
- **Fixed a script-concatenation bug that froze interactive tokens** — `page()` joined the shared micro-interaction layer and a token's own script (3js, simulation) with no separator, so the browser parsed `})()(function(){…})()` as a call on the first result and threw a TypeError. The orbit canvas and timeline never ran. The two IIFEs are now separated with a semicolon; a regression test locks in the fix.
- **Web-fonts toggle in the playground** — "Use web fonts" upgrades the chosen voice with Google Fonts; the flag travels through share links (`w`) and hash decode.
- **Currency and quantity extraction** — number extraction now captures `$49`, `$1,200`, `$2.1B`, `40 staff`, `12,000 cabinets`, and more, so pricing and counts survive into the redesign. 100-source stress test: 100% fidelity, 136/136 quality, 0 errors.
- **`scripts/stress-test.js`** — drives the real auto entry point across 100 diverse sources and reports design-QA, fidelity, and errors.

## v2.4.0

### Feature — the 10x builder upgrade (type, color, art, composition, self-critique)

- **Typographic voices** — the engine now picks a display/body/mono voice from the source's profile and seed (editorial, grotesque, techno, serifClassic, highContrast, expressive, monoForward), replacing the single hard-coded system stack. A fluid type scale (`--text-xs … --text-4xl`) and 4/8 spacing scale (`--space-1 … --space-10`) now ship on every page. Default output stays 100% offline; `--web-fonts` opts into Google Fonts for the chosen voice (exempted from the offline quality check).
- **OKLCH palette system** — `extract.js` now converts colors through OKLCH and derives two harmonious role colors (`accent2`, `accent3`) from the source accent by hue rotation at controlled chroma, plus internal lightness ramps. `--a2`/`--a3`/`--focus-ring` ship on `:root`; art layers reference them via `color-mix` so pages stay palette-constrained.
- **Composition bands** — a shared archetype library (`statsBand` count-up metrics, `bentoGrid`, `quoteBand`, `ctaBand`, `marqueeBand`, `footerBand`) lets tokens compose instead of hard-coding one page. `webpage`, `landing`, `infographic`, and `showcase` now assemble these bands from source facts.
- **Generative art primitives** — seeded `meshBackdrop` aurora fields, giant `dataWash` numbers, `dotGrid` halftones, `constellation` anchor networks, and CSS 3D `isometricStack` layers, all compositor-only and reduced-motion safe. A shared micro-interaction layer (cursor spotlight, tilt cards, count-up numbers) now runs on every token.
- **Content intelligence** — extraction adds `images`, `tables`, `tone`, `readingTime`, and script detection. A model-harness `plan` hook (`--plan '{"token":"landing","voice":"grotesque"}'`) forces a direction and voice through the same deterministic pipeline; `--brief` maps plain-language lenses to voices.
- **Self-critique (design-QA)** — `qualityScore` gains a 36-point design battery (type scale, art direction, motion system, palette constraint, fidelity ≥ 60%, landmarks). Auto re-rolls weak first draws for its top two directions before shipping, and reports `design.quality`/`voice`. `--emit` writes `design-token.json` + `quality-report.json` beside the artifact.
- **Playground 3-design loop** — Auto mode now shows three drawn directions with scores; pick one to load it, or hit **↻ Recreate** for a fresh draw.
- **Housekeeping** — removed superseded legacy artifacts (`RELEASE_v2.3.2.md`, `test/pipeline/`, `scripts/test.sh`, `scripts/scale_benchmark.py`, `gold/test_reimagine.ps1`). 8 new unit tests; 55 total.

---

## v2.3.8

### Feature — shareable playground links, benchmark, --diff

- **Shareable result links** — the no-install playground now encodes the source + token into the URL hash; any redesign can be sent as a one-click link that reproduces the same output (deterministic per-source seed).
- **15-token benchmark** — `scripts/benchmark-tokens.js` generates all 15 directions × 4 representative sources through the real CLI and writes `benchmark/BENCHMARK.md`: 100/100 usability, full fidelity, 18.4% mean pairwise output diversity. Table surfaced in the README.
- **`--diff` CLI flag** — `npx reimagine-it -i page.html --auto --diff` prints a before/after summary (direction, palette, anchors, art, fidelity, size) without writing a file.
- **Design Health badge** — the README header now carries the live status of the separate `design-health-action` repo's audit workflow.

---

## v2.3.7

### Feature — playground presets, horizon journey, richer token upgrades

- **"Try it — no install" playground upgrade** — the in-page playground now lists all 16 directions (auto + 15 tokens, including the previously missing `showcase` button and marquee entry) and adds four one-click sample sources (game, café, observability, travel) so visitors can reimagine a real page instantly.
- **New horizon example journey** — `examples/end-users/horizon/` turns a plain observability/SLO page into a navy mission-control dashboard (auto picks `dashboard`): KPI cards with sparklines, donut chart, and scaled bars, plus `gradient` (kinetic headline) and `landing` alternates. It is the 7th entry in the hero cycler and case grid.
- **Token upgrades from the design audit** — photography plates get monogram glyphs; the svg token gets a data strip (donut/bars) when the source has numbers; glass panels get prism accents; the gradient headline gets kinetic gradient-text reveal. Glyph tiles gained a staggered idle float.
- **Fix — percentage metrics now extract** — `99.99%` and `42%`-style numbers never matched the number regex (a trailing `\b` after the non-word `%` char). Switched to a negative lookahead; regression test added. Data-heavy sources now show their real percentages in charts.

### Feature — content-derived art layer in every builder

- **Shared art layer** — the engine now ships inline content-derived graphics in every token: anchor initials become monogram glyph tiles, source numbers become SVG donut charts and horizontal bars, and the palette shades isometric 3D prisms. All SVG, all offline, all deterministic per seed.
- **Wired across all 15 builders** — landing hero art (glyph tiles + floating prism), dashboard signal panels (donut + bars), infographic mix section, gradient card watermarks, glass panel prisms, artistic field glyphs, cinematic opening constellation, motion floating tiles, editorial data pullout, simulation glyph row, webpage hero prism, and showcase capability cards.
- **`showcase` token activated** — it was a half-wired direction: Auto could recommend it, but the engine never registered it, and its implementation sat as dead code inside `gradient()`. It is now a first-class 15th builder (capability cards, timeline, stat counters) with content glyphs replacing the old `#` placeholder icons, and it appears in the token board, gallery chips, README, and audits.
- **Stale audit references fixed** — `audit-tokens.js`, `render-audit.js`, and `build-token-board.py` pointed at the removed `tide-letter` example and capped at 14 tokens; they now use a current example and audit all 15.

### Fix — token tiles show real examples; watermark overlap removed

- **Every token tile now shows its actual output** — the 14 direction cards in the `#tokens` section were text-only. Each card now embeds a real screenshot of that token's generated page (`tokens/<name>-desktop.png`), with a numbered badge on the image corner, so visitors see what each direction produces before clicking.
- **Ghost-numeral overlap removed** — the old cards used an absolutely-positioned 54px watermark (`::before` numeral) that sat on top of the card text and collided with titles on narrow cards. The number now lives in a small pill badge inside the image thumb, and the card body has its own padding.
- **Tiles are clickable** — clicking a tile scrolls to the gallery above and selects that token's desktop + phone previews (and its animated GIF for 3js/motion).

### Fix — landing headline overlap at phone widths; full-bleed exhibit cards

- **Landing token headline no longer collides** — the landing hero forced `h1{max-width:8ch}` with `line-height:.88`, so two-word titles like "Ember & Table" wrapped into two lines that visually overlapped when the phone screenshot was scaled down. Now `max-width:15ch` with `line-height:.96` and a slightly smaller clamp — titles stay on one line down to phone width, verified by pixel-band analysis of the 480px render.
- **Exhibit cards are full-bleed** — the Dribbble-style cards in `examples/end-users/build.py` reserved only a 396×296 browser window (55% × 41% of the 720×720 card) inside thick chrome. The browser window is now 664×559 (92% × 78%) and phone frames 312×570, with `ImageOps.fit` (crop-to-fill) instead of `contain` (letterbox) so the design fills the frame edge-to-edge — no more tiny preview inside a big block. Caption and footer strips verified non-overlapping.
- **Hero cycler shows the full card** — the transform stage was `aspect-ratio:4/4.6` with `object-fit:cover`, cropping the square GIF's sides. Now `1/1` so the complete card is visible.
- Regenerated all four `before-after.gif`, `gallery.gif`, the token board, and the 3js/motion animated GIFs from the fixed engine.

---

## v2.3.6

### New — CI token audits, data-heavy Auto detection, animated + live gallery

- **CI token audits** — `scripts/audit-tokens.js` (structural: undefined/NaN/empty body/misplaced markup) and `scripts/render-audit.js` (headless Chrome render: visible text, no horizontal overflow, heading) now run as a `token-audit` job in `.github/workflows/audit.yml` on every push touching the engine. `render-audit.js` is self-contained (srcdoc iframes, no server) so it runs on Ubuntu runners and Windows alike.
- **Data-heavy Auto detection** — the infographic token now gets a strong boost when the source has ≥6 measurable facts or is density-`rich`, and the Auto rationale says so explicitly ("The source is data-heavy (N measurable facts)…"). Verified: the field-report source picks infographic; the tide essay still picks editorial.
- **Animated gallery** — the `3js` and `motion` tokens now show looping capture GIFs (`tokens/3js-anim.gif`, `motion-anim.gif`) in the gallery instead of static shots.
- **Live demo** — a "▶ Live demo" toggle renders the current token's output in the browser via the in-page engine, in a scrollable desktop frame and a scrollable phone frame; flip it off to return to the static previews.

## v2.3.5

### New — token gallery upgrades

- **Auto chip** — the gallery now leads with `auto`, showing the scored best-of-three direction (for the showcase source: editorial, score 182), then all 14 tokens.
- **Before / After toggle** — each preview flips to the untouched source with one click (shared `tokens/before-desktop.png` / `before-phone.png`).
- **Infographic showcase section** — a new data-heavy source (`examples/infographic/source.html`, a field-season report with 14 species, 320 miles, 1,180 hours, 42% jump) rendered at wide desktop width and tall phone width, with the source and command documented.
- **Token audit tooling** — `scripts/audit-tokens.js` (structural: undefined/NaN/empty-body/misplaced-markup) and `scripts/render-audit.js` (headless render: visible text, no horizontal overflow, heading present). All 14 tokens pass both.

### Fix — the `webpage` token again (patch over 2.3.4)

2.3.4 shipped a broken `webpage` generator (empty body), fixed in this release. Token gallery added; examples sharpened. See v2.3.4 notes below for the full list.

## v2.3.4

### Fix — `webpage` token shipped an empty page

The `webpage` generator called `page(title, bodyHTML)` but `page(title, css, body, script)` expects the stylesheet as its second argument. The entire markup landed inside the `<style>` tag and `<body>` was the literal string `undefined`. The missing `css` argument is now passed, so the token emits the full page (`<main class="page">`, hero, contents, and sections) again.

### Fix — noisy hero chips and blurry headless rendering

The landing hero's decorative chips used `backdrop-filter: blur(8px)` with no fallback, which rendered as smudges under software rasterization. Removed the blur (the chips keep their solid card look), and the example builder no longer forces `--use-gl=swiftshader`, so headless screenshots use the real GPU path and come out sharp. Phone screenshots also render at 480px (was 430px) for crisper text.

### New — token showcase gallery (wide + tall)

Every one of the 14 tokens now renders at desktop and phone width. The landing page replaces the cramped single-image grid with an interactive gallery — large desktop preview plus a phone preview, 14 selector chips, and prev/next — and ships the individual `docs/tokens/*-desktop.png` / `*-phone.png` shots plus `tokens-board.png` (desktop grid) and `tokens-phone.png` (phone grid).

### Fix — MCP server import paths

The MCP server required SDK subpaths without the `.js` suffix (`@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/stdio`, `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/types`). Against the SDK's exports map (v1.30.0) those resolve to extension-less paths and fail with MODULE_NOT_FOUND, so `npx reimagine-it-mcp` never started. Both imports now use the canonical `.js` subpaths and the server boots and negotiates correctly.

Also: `reimagine-it@2.3.3` is now live on npm, and `NPM_TOKEN` is configured as a repository secret so every future release auto-publishes through the workflow.

## v2.3.3

### New — the remaining generators close the gap

- **webpage** — contents pills light up on hover; section rhythm unchanged and quiet.
- **infographic** — fixed a real bug: the row-entrance animation referenced a `row-in` keyframe that was never defined, so rows never animated. Keyframe added; rows now rise in.
- **photography** — fixed the same bug class: `plate-in` was referenced but undefined; plates now fade in.
- **motion** — ghost step numerals float behind each reveal; the numbered dot pulses on hover.
- **glass** — panels lift, brighten, and glow on hover; the sheen sweep is reactive.
- **simulation** — the active step now gets a glowing ring; the title draws a rule beneath it.
- **showcase** — capability icons scale and tilt on hover.

### Case-study bundles

- Every end-user example now ships a **CASE_STUDY.md** with the exact command, Auto rationale, score, fidelity %, alternatives, and GIF proof.
- New **docs/CASE_STUDIES.md** index table links all four bundles; linked from the README and the Pages landing page.
- The publish workflow's npm step was verified: it validates green but skips publication until `secrets.NPM_TOKEN` is configured in the repository.

## v2.3.2

### New — Dribbble-grade design engine

- **Premium shared shell for every token.** All nine generators now sit on one polished craft floor: a subtle film-grain overlay, a scroll-progress bar in the accent color, a tinted scrollbar, deduplicated `@property` tokens, and View Transitions — so every page feels finished, not templated.
- **Landing token redesigned.** Dribbble-style hero with an animated art panel — a breathing gradient core, orbiting dashed ring, drifting glow, and floating content chips — plus a scrolling keyword marquee and a crisp headline treatment (the old blur veil that dimmed titles is gone).
- **Dashboard token refined.** Ambient accent glow at the top of the viewport, a pulsing "live" dot in the header, gradient-sheen metric cards that lift with an accent glow on hover, glowing sparklines, and scroll-driven entrance animations (previously referenced but never defined).

### Data honesty — the extractor stops fabricating

- Bare 2+ digit numbers (phone fragments, IDs, hours like `09:00` or `18`) are no longer treated as facts. Only unit-qualified numbers survive — `142 ms`, `27 users`, `$29`, `12 miles` — so output pages never invent metrics.
- Infographic rows no longer show fake `anchor signal` values; a number appears only when it literally occurs in that section's text, otherwise bars honestly show relative section length.
- `showcase` no longer invents numeric captions when the source has none.

### Auto — smarter, non-repetitive token selection

- `webpage` was scored three times in the selection loop and won almost every text-heavy job; it is now scored once.
- `dashboard` requires operational language (uptime, latency, deploy, traffic) instead of winning on generic words like "users".
- Routing now produces structurally distinct outputs for similar-looking jobs: release-ops pages → `dashboard`, menus → `landing`, essays → `editorial`, stories → `cinematic`.

### Housekeeping

- Removed stale tracked `auto-options/` build artifacts no script produces.
- Version bumped to 2.3.3 across package, extension manifest, plugin manifests, skill frontmatter, and README badge/pin.

### MCP and extension (also shipped in this line)

- **MCP server** (`mcp/server.js`): exposes reimagine-it as Model Context Protocol tools — `reimagine`, `extract_content`, `list_tokens`, `audit_html`. Any MCP-compatible agent can call reimagine-it without installing the full skill. Run with `npx reimagine-it-mcp`.
- **Browser extension** (`extension/`): Chrome/Edge/Firefox extension that adds a toolbar button to reimagine the current HTML page. Extracts content in-browser, generates a redesigned page, opens it in a new tab. No server, no API. 8 tokens supported.

## v2.3.1

### Fixes

- **CLI infographic and dashboard generators had no CSS.** Both tokens output class-based HTML (`.poster`, `.chart`, `.bar`, `.dashboard`, `.kpi-card`, etc.) but the `<style>` block only contained `:root` and accessibility rules. Pages rendered completely unstyled. Added full CSS for all classes in both generators.
- **CLI title extraction.** The extractor fell back to the filename (`before`) instead of deriving a title from `<h1>` content. Now reads `<h1>` before falling back.
- **CLI creative variation.** Same source + token without `--seed` produced identical output every run. Added a seeded PRNG (mulberry32) with three creative axes: anchor shuffle, palette rotation, vibe selection. `--seed 42` reproduces; no seed = fresh each run.
- **Palette consistency.** The `artistic`, `cinematic`, and `photography` generators used the un-rotated palette instead of the rotated one, ignoring the creative variation engine. All generators now use the rotated palette.
- **CI: `publish-action.yml` YAML parse failure.** The release-notes heredoc body was written flush-left inside the `run: |` block, terminating the YAML block scalar early. Rewrote both fragile steps as properly-indented `python - <<'PYEOF'` blocks.
- **CI: PyYAML missing on runner.** The validate step imported `yaml` but `setup-python` does not include PyYAML. Added `pip install pyyaml`.
- **CI: audit smoke step killed by `set -e`.** `audit_all.py`'s exit code 1 (warnings-only) aborted the script before the failure threshold check could run. Wrapped with `set +e` and `PIPESTATUS[0]`.
- **CI: audit workflow exit-code masking.** The audit step piped `audit_all.py` through `tee` and read `$?` (tee's exit code), masking real craft-floor failures. Now captures `PIPESTATUS[0]`.
- **CI: deprecated Node 20 actions.** All three workflows bumped to `checkout@v5`, `setup-python@v6`, `setup-node@v6`.
- **`.npmignore`: removed stale `.npmrc` reference** (file does not exist in the repo).

## v2.3

**Ship date:** August 2026

### What's new

- **Infographic pack rewritten.** The infographic domain is now a statistical poster of an argument — common-scale encodings, ISOTYPE unit counts, custom glyphs, lossless data table. Explicit guardrail: not a CV, not an AntV template clone. No pies, donuts, gauges, 3D, or fabricated KPIs (Cleveland–McGill / Neurath ISOTYPE floor).
- **Guardrail gold added for Jules.** Second-source infographic poster (6-flavor sequence, star-around-cone, 8 mint tubs) proves the infographic method travels.
- **Motion strip regenerated** to include infographic pack (Lone Star pulse + bluebonnet sway on the paper board).
- **Audit tool:** `scripts/audit.py` — 18 deterministic quality checks across typography, palette, motion, content, structure, and performance. No LLM, no API key. CI-ready with `--json` output and exit codes.
- **Product landing page:** `docs/index.html` rewritten as a polished product site with hero, 4-step method, expanded install grid, and embedded playground.
- **Three new gold sources** proving the method travels beyond Texas: Pulsewave (SaaS), Two Lights (personal essay), Saffron & Smoke (restaurant menu).
- **README rewrite:** from 632-line dissertation to 249-line pitch with 6 inline visuals, above-the-fold install command, and prominent playground link.
- **SKILL.md description** tightened to a routing rule ("Content-Derived Design") instead of a feature list.
- **Submissions drafted** for skills.sh, composio.dev, awesome-agent-skills, Cursor Directory, and Firecrawl.

## v2.2

**Ship date:** Summer 2026

### What's new

- **Three hard guarantees** now enforced on every render:
  1. **Same-format twin by default.** Point at a distributable file (`.pdf`, `.docx`, `.pptx`, `.mobi`, `.epub`, `.md`) and get two artifacts: companion HTML + same-format twin.
  2. **Visual verification pass.** Hero rendered to image and manually scanned for blank plates, placeholders, clipped text, broken SVGs, off-palette accents, fabricated content, dead motion, and unmapped plates.
  3. **Craft floor on every webpage output.** Focus ring contrast ≥ 3:1, `::selection` on-palette, compositor-only motion, `prefers-reduced-motion` respected by decomposing, no `transition: all`, no `outline: 0` without replacement, scroll-driven animations, Core Web Vitals sane.

- **Creative engine sampling seven axes:** reader register, ground/palette weighting, hero move, plate style, motion budget, type accent, 3D signature. Three visibly different reader registers from the same `/reimagine-it webpage` command.

- **`--seed` and `--variant`** for reproducibility. `--variant a` → Draw A (dashboard-live), `--variant b` → Draw B (field-guide-quiet), `--variant c` → Draw C (cinematic-shader).

- **Draw C (cinematic-shader register):** full-bleed WebGL2 west-Texas sunset shader, kinetic serif wordmark, scroll-driven plate rise, click-to-spin Lone Star. Ships the full v2.2 craft floor.

- **Motion strip** proving every animation claim with three frames per pack spaced ~1.6 s apart.

- **Jules Ice Cream second source:** parlor DNA — counter, cone, freezer — proving the method travels.

- **Lock system:** `/reimagine-it lock <path> as <name>` extracts design DNA into a portable markdown pack. Cross-medium translation table included.

- **150+ source research pack** (`references/research/web-craft-2025.md`): Awwwards SOTY nominee stack, Rauno/Emil craft floor, Lupi/Fragapane data humanism, Feixen/Weingart/Troxler print grammar, Apple AIDA cinematic, view-transitions, scroll-driven animations, kinetic type, sound, neubrutalism.
