## agentskills.io / skills.sh

**Submit at:** [agentskills.io/submit](https://agentskills.io/submit) (or whichever platform accepts submissions)

**Title:** reimagine-it

**Tagline:** Content-Derived Design — an AI agent skill that reads your file and redesigns it from its own content.

**Description:**

reimagine-it is the only agent skill that does Content-Derived Design. Instead of enforcing generic taste rules (ban Inter, use proper spacing), it reads your actual source file and derives palette, motifs, and motion from the concrete nouns, dates, and colors already in your content.

A Texas notebook gets navy / red / gold because the source names the Lone Star flag. A restaurant menu gets clay / saffron because the dishes mention saffron and open fire. A SaaS observability page gets dark teal and trace-wave paths because the content says "traces" and "water balloon."

Works in Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Copilot, Gemini CLI, and any Agent Skills host — or with no agent at all (`npx reimagine-it`). Ships a single offline HTML file — no Figma, no CDN. v2.7.0 adds `extract` (audit exactly which facts the engine reads, as JSON), an 8-tool MCP server (`npx reimagine-it mcp`), and CI-enforced proof: every committed example must regenerate byte-identically from the committed engine.

**Install:**
```
npx skills add Kayforkind/reimagine-it
```

**GitHub:** https://github.com/Kayforkind/reimagine-it

**Live demo:** https://kayforkind.github.io/reimagine-it/

## composio.dev — "Top 10 Design Skills" / "Best Claude Code Skills"

**Contact:** Find the submission form at composites.io or reach out to their content team via the blog.

**Pitch:**

I wanted to submit reimagine-it for inclusion in your "Top Design Skills" roundup. It's the only agent skill that does content-derived design — palette, motifs, and motion are extracted from the source file's own nouns and dates, rather than enforcing a fixed set of taste rules.

While Anthropic's frontend-design (277k installs) and Impeccable enforce design quality constraints, reimagine-it reads the actual content and builds a unique design language from it. Nine committed journeys (crypto game, festival, skate brand, juice bar, streetwear, living building, observability, bakery, city budget) prove the method travels across genres — every one reporting 100% source fidelity, every artifact CI-verified to regenerate byte-identically.

- GitHub: https://github.com/Kayforkind/reimagine-it
- Live gallery + playground (no agent required): https://kayforkind.github.io/reimagine-it/
- Install: `npx skills add Kayforkind/reimagine-it`
- llms.txt for agents: https://kayforkind.github.io/reimagine-it/llms.txt

**Differentiators vs existing skills:**
- Content-Derived Design (unique — no other skill derives design from source content)
- 9 committed demo journeys with verifiable Auto reports (not just one)
- `extract` command: the honesty layer as a standalone tool — see every fact the engine reads
- MCP server: 8 tools over stdio, any MCP host, no SDK required on the user side
- CI-enforced proof: reproduction guard, stills guard, weekly 250-seed fidelity stress
- Browser playground (no agent required to try it)
- Works across Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Copilot, Gemini CLI, Factory Droid, Pi, Windsurf
- Offline HTML output — single file, no CDN, no Figma

## Cursor Directory (cursor.directory)

**Submit at:** https://cursor.directory/submit (or the equivalent)

**Title:** reimagine-it

**Category:** Design / Frontend

**Description:**

An AI agent skill for Content-Derived Design. Reads your source file and redesigns it from its own content — palette, motifs, and motion are derived from nouns, dates, and colors already in the source. Not a mood board. A real artifact.

Works in Cursor, Claude Code, Codex, Copilot, and Gemini CLI. Ships a single offline HTML file.

**Tags:** design, frontend, html, css, redesign, infographic, svg, threejs, simulation, content-derived

**Repository:** Kayforkind/reimagine-it

**Install:** `npx skills add Kayforkind/reimagine-it`

**How it works (for the description):**

1. Point at any HTML file
2. `/reimagine-it webpage` — rebuilds it with content-derived palette, motifs, and motion
3. `/reimagine-it infographic` — statistical poster of facts in the file
4. `/reimagine-it svg` — living vector mark with micro-motion
5. `/reimagine-it 3js` — orbitable 3D room from the source nouns
6. `/reimagine-it simulation` — playable model of the file's timeline/sequence

## Firecrawl "Best Claude Code Skills" article

**Contact:** Firecrawl content team or Hiba Fathima (author of the Aug 3, 2026 roundup)

**Pitch:**

I noticed reimagine-it isn't in your "19 Best Claude Code Skills" roundup — wanted to flag it because it does something no other design skill does: Content-Derived Design.

Every other design skill (frontend-design, Impeccable, etc.) enforces generic quality rules. reimagine-it reads the source file's actual content and derives palette, motifs, and motion from the nouns, dates, and colors already there. A Texas notebook gets navy/red/gold from the Lone Star flag; a restaurant menu gets clay/saffron from the dish names.

- 9 committed demo journeys (gaming to civic budget), each at 100% source fidelity
- `extract` command: audit exactly which facts the engine reads — the honesty layer as a tool
- 8-tool MCP server (`npx reimagine-it mcp`) for any MCP host
- CI-enforced proof: every committed artifact must regenerate byte-identically from the engine
- Browser playground (no agent install required)
- 15 design variants from one source, with Auto picking the strongest
- Works across Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Copilot, Gemini CLI

**r/ClaudeCode, r/cursor, r/ChatGPTCoding:**

**Title:** reimagine-it — an agent skill that redesigns from your file's own content, not a mood board

I built reimagine-it because every AI design tool produces the same output: Inter for everything, purple-to-blue gradients, cards nested in cards. The problem isn't the model — it's that no one tells the model to look at the *content*.

reimagine-it reads your file and builds a design language from it:
- Extracts proper nouns, dates, color words, numbers from the source
- Builds a palette from those words (Texas → navy/red/gold, restaurant → clay/saffron)
- Picks a geometric motif that repeats across the page
- Ships one offline HTML file — no CDN, no Figma

Install:
```
npx skills add Kayforkind/reimagine-it
```

Then: `/reimagine-it webpage`, `/reimagine-it infographic`, `/reimagine-it svg`, `/reimagine-it 3js`, `/reimagine-it simulation`

Try it in the browser (no agent required): https://kayforkind.github.io/reimagine-it/

## Reusable kit (was SUBMISSION_KIT.md)

**One-line:** Turn an existing HTML page into a beautiful, usable standalone redesign without losing its meaning.

**Short:** reimagine-it is a dependency-free CLI and Agent Skill for content-derived design. Design Auto reads headings, facts, links, dates, numbers, and colors from an existing HTML source, chooses a fitting visual direction from 17, and produces an inspectable standalone artifact with a fidelity report.

**Why different:** It starts from source evidence instead of a generic style prompt. Output is offline HTML, deterministic with a seed, reviewable through the decision and fidelity report — and every committed proof regenerates byte-identically in CI.

## Show HN draft (was SHOW-HN.md)

**Title:** Show HN: reimagine-it – redesign existing HTML from its own content (CLI)

**URL:** https://github.com/Kayforkind/reimagine-it

**Text:**

```
npx reimagine-it --auto -i page.html -o redesign.html
```

Paste HTML. Get one standalone page — offline, no CDN, no Figma. The engine reads headings, facts, names, dates, numbers, links, emails, and hex colors already in the file. It does not invent a SaaS landing page.

Auto scores the source into a subject lane (game, festival, skate, food, fashion, architecture, ops, …) and will not put two tokens from the same silhouette on the shortlist. Seventeen directions now, including a photoshoot lookbook and a living particle field; a AAA motion pack (kinetic type, magnetic buttons, glow-follow cards, inertia-orbit 3D with fact billboards) ships on every token. Nine committed journeys:

- crypto battle royale → gradient
- music festival → cinematic
- skate brand → artistic
- juice bar → landing
- streetwear drop → photography
- living building → 3js (+ editorial + svg)
- observability → dashboard
- bakery bake gallery → photography
- city budget report → infographic (timeline first fold)

Live playground (no install): https://kayforkind.github.io/reimagine-it/#playground
Results: https://kayforkind.github.io/reimagine-it/#results

Also: `variations`, `lock` / `--ref`, and `audit` (19 deterministic Design Health rules, no LLM). MCP: `npx reimagine-it mcp`.

Post only after `npm view reimagine-it version` matches the release tag — HN punishes a demo that `npx` cannot reproduce.
